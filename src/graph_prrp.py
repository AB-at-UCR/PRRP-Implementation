Graph-Based PRRP Implementation

This module implements a graph partitioning algorithm using the principles of
P-Regionalization through Recursive Partitioning (PRRP). It ensures:
    - Connectivity preservation via articulation point checks (using Tarjanâ€™s Algorithm helpers).
    - Efficient handling of graphs through an adjacency list (via construct_adjacency_list).
    - Recursive partitioning with growth, merging of disconnected areas, and splitting of oversized partitions.
    
The graph input is expected to be provided in METIS format (parsed via metis_parser.py)
or already as an adjacency list. This implementation leverages utilities from utils.py.
